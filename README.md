# Philadelphia Brewery Guide
For our final capstone at Tech Elevator,my team was tasked with creating a brewery finder web app for the city of Philadelphia. The app allowed users and brewery owners to create an account. When someone visits the site without logging in, they are able to see the list of breweries, view the breweries individual pages, and view the reviews for the beers. If someone wants to rate and post a review for a beer they have to be logged in. When someone is logged in as a brewer, their homepage displays all of the breweries they own/manage. They are able to add new breweries to the database, and add/update/delete beers for each of their breweries. Anyone can register as a brewer owner and add new breweries, but they have to be verified and approved by a site admin. When a site admin is logged in, their homepage lists all of the unapproved breweries and they have the option to either approve the brewery or delete it. They can also view a list of all registered users/brewers. The admin is able to click on a user to view all of the reviews they have written and delete any inappropriate/offensive reviews.

The app has a SQL database that stores the user info, breweries, beer, and reviews. The front end runs on Vue.js framework, with a REST API to complete the MCV.

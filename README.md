# Philadelphia Brewery Guide
For our final capstone at Tech Elevator,my team was tasked with creating a brewery finder web app for the city of Philadelphia. The app allowed users and brewery owners to create an account. when a brewery owner is logged in, they have the ability to add a new brewery to the database, add new beers to any of their breweries, and update/delete beers. When a user is logged in they are able to leave a review/rating for any of the beers. Viewing the list of breweries and beers does not require a user to be logged in.

The app has a SQL database that stores the user info, breweries, beer, and review. The front end runs on Vue.js framework, with a REST API to complete the MCV.
